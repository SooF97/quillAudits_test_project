## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive blockchain-based solution that includes an upgradeable smart contract with a known vulnerability, accompanied by microservices for exploit detection, notification, and prevention. Additionally, the project includes detailed reporting and analytics features.

## Objectives

1. **Smart Contract Development:**

   - Develop an upgradeable Solidity smart contract that is intentionally vulnerable to reentrancy or flash loan attacks.
   - Incorporate `Ownable` and `Pausable` functionalities using OpenZeppelin libraries.

2. **Exploit Detection and Notification Microservice:**

   - Create a microservice using Node.js/Python/Rust/Go that monitors the blockchain for exploit attempts.
   - The microservice should send an email notification when a potential exploit is detected.

3. **Front-running Microservice:**

   - Develop a second microservice that can front-run transactions to pause the contract before a suspicious transaction occurs.
   - Implement a dynamic gas pricing strategy to ensure timely execution of the pausing transaction.

4. **Detailed Reporting and Analytics:**

   - Implement a system to store detailed reports in a database.
   - Provide analytics on system performance, potential vulnerabilities (using tools like Slither), and the effectiveness of the pausing mechanism.

5. **Manual Upgrade Functionality:**
   - Ensure the smart contract can be manually upgraded to fix the vulnerability after receiving a notification.

## Deliverables

1. **Git Repository Access:**

   - Provide access to a Git repository containing all the microservices and smart contract code.
   - Include this README file in the repository.
